Returning to the U.S. After Living in China: A Bit of Reverse Culture Shock  
在中国生活后回到美国：有点反向文化冲击
=================================================================================================

[

🏯 Daily Life

](/r/chinalife/?f=flair_name%3A%22%F0%9F%8F%AF%20Daily%20Life%22)

Returning to U.S. after living in China for some years was truly an experience of all time. It seems like most of my friends and families still have great misunderstandings about living in China, social credit score and all that. China is not a perfect place, but it does make some aspects of life easier than in the U.S..  
在中国生活了几年后回到美国真是一次前所未有的经历。似乎我的大多数朋友和家人仍然对在中国生活，社会信用评分和所有这些有很大的误解。中国不是一个完美的地方，但它确实使生活的某些方面比美国更容易。

My first meal back home with friends gave me a reverse culture shock that makes me realize just that. The food was alright but when it came time to pay, I had to rush to our car and grab my debit card because they couldn't accept my credit card. And don’t even get me started on all the guilt-trip tipping screens at checkout. It made me miss how in China, the price you see is the price you pay—no hidden fees, no tipping drama. But that was just the beginning:  
我和朋友回家的第一顿饭给了我一个反向文化冲击，让我意识到这一点。食物还不错，但是到了付款的时候，我不得不冲到我们的车里，拿上我的借记卡，因为他们不接受我的信用卡。更别说结账时那些内疚的小费屏幕了。这让我怀念在中国，你看到的价格就是你付出的价格--没有隐藏的费用，没有小费的戏剧。但这仅仅是个开始：

**1\. Having to Worry About Payment  
1.不得不担心付款**

Chinese businesses are light-years ahead when it comes to payment. Doesn’t matter if it’s a fancy restaurant or a street vendor selling dumplings—you can always pay with a QR code or even scan your palm. It’s fast, simple, and works everywhere. But in the U.S., while Apple Pay has gotten a lot more popular, some small businesses still don't accept credit cards. It is not a huge deal, but it's about the lack of reassurance. It’s just not smooth like WeChat Pay, where you always know you’re covered.  
在支付方面，中国企业遥遥领先。无论是高档餐厅还是街头小贩卖的饺子，你都可以用二维码甚至扫描你的手掌付款。它快速，简单，适用于任何地方。但在美国，虽然Apple Pay越来越受欢迎，但一些小企业仍然不接受信用卡。这不是一个大问题，但它是关于缺乏保证。只是不像微信支付那样流畅，在微信支付里你总是知道自己被覆盖了。

**2\. Having to Drive Everywhere  
2.到处开车**

Chinese cities aren’t always perfectly designed, but they’re so much more walkable than most American cities. Everything I needed—groceries, restaurants, whatever—was within a 20-minute walk. If I needed to go farther, public transit was cheap, reliable, and connected to one app. Feeling energetic? Rent a bike for pennies. Feeling lazy? Hail a ride for a couple of bucks. Back in the U.S., I feel chained to my friend’s car. Either I’m tagging along with them, or waiting 30 minutes for a bus that may or may not show up on time.  
中国城市的设计并不总是完美的，但他们比大多数美国城市更适合步行。我所需要的一切--杂货店、餐馆、杂货店--都在20分钟步行范围内。如果我需要去更远的地方，公共交通很便宜，可靠，并连接到一个应用程序。租一辆自行车。懒了？几巴克斯就能搭个便车。回到美国，我感觉被锁在朋友的车里了。要么我跟着他们沿着，要么等30分钟的公共汽车，也许会准时出现，也许不会。

**3\. Having to Install Every App  
3.必须安装每个应用程序**

In China, WeChat does everything. Messaging, payments, bills, shopping, booking appointments—you name it, WeChat’s got it. It’s one app for literally everything. Here? Every place has its own app. Want to see a doctor? Better download their app. Want to check in at a different clinic? Congrats, now you need another app. And then they just sit on your phone for months because you’re scared to delete them in case you need them again. My home screen’s a cluttered mess.  
在中国，微信可以做任何事情。短信、支付、账单、购物、预订商品--你能想到的，微信都有。它是一款几乎可以实现一切的应用程序。在这里吗？每个地方都有自己的应用程序。想看医生吗？最好下载他们的应用程序。想去别的诊所登记吗？恭喜你，现在你需要另一个应用程序了。然后它们就在你的手机上呆了几个月，因为你害怕删除它们，以防你再次需要它们。我的主屏幕一片混乱。

**4\. The Reality of Chinese Internet  
4.中国互联网的现实**

Yes, the Great Firewall is real, and censorship can be super annoying. But honestly? The local content have their own charm. You can find everything from brain rot memes to university lectures. And if you want to bypass the restrictions? VPNs are easy to use. I could still check Facebook, watch YouTube, or keep up with international news without much hassle. In a weird way, I had the best of both worlds while living there.  
是的，防火长城是真实的，审查制度可能超级烦人。但说实话当地的内容有自己的魅力。你可以找到从大脑腐烂模因到大学讲座的一切。如果你想绕过限制呢？VPN很容易使用。我仍然可以查看Facebook，观看YouTube，或跟上国际新闻，没有太多麻烦。在一个奇怪的方式，我有最好的两个世界，而住在那里。

Does anyone else who’s gone back home for the holidays feel the same? Or is it just me? Anyway, better vent here than IRL—don’t wanna get accused of being mistaken for a government shill lol.  
其他回家过节的人也有同样的感觉吗？还是只有我这么觉得无论如何，最好在这里发泄比IRL不想被指责被误认为是政府的shill哈哈。

I live in both country now , about 3-4 month out of the year I’m in China.  

China is more convenient and the US is quieter.  I enjoy both in different ways.

My biggest shock was the lack of people everywhere and every moment. I went from living in a 小区 inside the 3rd ring road in Beijing to temporarily moving to my hometown with 7000 people. One of the first days back home, I took a 30 minute walk and saw two people outside, and around ten cars.  
我最大的震惊是到处都没有人，每时每刻。我从住在北京三环内的一个小区，到暂时搬到7000人的家乡。回到家的第一天，我走了30分钟，看到外面有两个人，大约有十辆汽车。

I've never had problems with payments here though. I actually think using NFC (Google Pay) is faster and easier than pulling up Alipay when I am in China.  
不过，我在这里从未遇到过付款问题。我实际上认为使用NFC（谷歌支付）比我在中国时使用支付宝更快，更容易。

America isn’t lonely! If anything in the US it’s easier to make deeper connections instead of just surface niceties. Even small towns have lots to do and friendly faces are common. In the US if you don’t live in a city, then you have to conform a bit to what’s available.  
美国并不孤独！如果说在美国有什么不同的话，那就是更容易建立更深层次的联系，而不仅仅是表面上的细节。即使是小城镇也有很多事情要做，友好的面孔也很常见。在美国，如果你不住在城市里，那么你就必须符合一些现有的条件。

I mean I wouldn’t say China is lonely either. The car culture is annoying but in most cities you’re fine with public transportation. Also I feel like foreigners often forget that most of us are in the upper income bracket in China. A lot of younger Chinese can’t afford the rec life that we can.  
我也不会说中国是孤独的。汽车文化令人讨厌，但在大多数城市，你可以乘坐公共交通工具。而且我觉得外国人经常忘记我们大多数人在中国都是高收入阶层。很多中国年轻人负担不起我们能负担的娱乐生活。

Too many weird expats who aren’t starting over because of curiosity about a new country or because of a break up etc. way too many are starting over bc they socially cannot function well in their home country and were rejected by too many women/jobs/friend circles. I hate over generalizing like this but when I am seriously weirded out by almost half the expats I meet, it’s no longer an overgeneralization.  
太多奇怪的外国人因为对一个新国家的好奇心或因为分手等原因而没有重新开始，太多的人重新开始，他们在自己的祖国社交能力不好，被太多的女人/工作/朋友圈拒绝。我讨厌像这样过度概括，但当我遇到的几乎一半的外籍人士让我感到非常奇怪时，这不再是过度概括。

Though many expats are perfectly normal, intelligent people!

I made the transition in 2018 after about 9 years in China. My biggest gripes/differences is:  
我在中国生活了大约9年后，于2018年完成了转型。我最大的抱怨/分歧是：

Food. To me, China is just so far ahead with great food and its availability. We cook mostly at home in the US and never eat out leading to us being lazy and cooking the same things. No food in the US really does it for us, even upscale restaurant food is kind of crappy here. I miss the 20+ restaurants within a 5 minute walk from my apartment which is located just above a grocery store. I ate much better and healthier in China.  
食物对我来说，中国只是在食物和可用性方面遥遥领先。在美国，我们大多在家里做饭，从不出去吃饭，这导致我们懒惰，做同样的东西。在美国，没有什么食物能真正为我们做到这一点，即使是高档餐厅的食物也有点糟糕。我很怀念从我的公寓步行5分钟就能到的20多家餐馆，我的公寓就在一家杂货店的上面。我在中国吃得更好，更健康。

Lack of people and true public spaces. In the US 99% of time there's nobody anywhere. It's nice when you want to just go run an errand but kind of miss the feeling of walking around with so much happening in China.  
缺乏人和真正的公共空间。在美国，99%的时间里，任何地方都没有人。当你只想出去跑个腿，但又有点怀念在中国到处走走的感觉时，这很好。

Public trans. I lived in the city in the US when I first went back and not having a car was extremely annoying compared to china. I always describe it as the entirety of China feels like it's "inside", as in i dont need a car or walk an insane amount to get from one place to another. Train to subway to taxi to ebike, China is just so convenient to get around.  
我第一次回去的时候住在美国的城市里，和中国相比，没有车是非常烦人的。我总是把它描述为整个中国感觉就像是“在里面”，就像我不需要开车或走一段疯狂的路从一个地方到另一个地方。从火车到地铁，从出租车到电动车，中国到处都很方便。

Friend culture. In china friends hitting you up daily to go do stuff within hours. This might be because im older now with more obligations, but in the US i need to make plans weeks in advance just for a meal with a friend.  
朋友文化在中国，朋友们每天都会打电话给你，让你在几个小时内完成任务。这可能是因为我现在年纪大了，有更多的义务，但在美国，我需要提前几周做计划，只是为了和朋友吃饭。

If you are eating home cooked meals now..there is no way you are eating worse than in China when you always ate at restaurants. Unless you really can't cook and call hotdogs and Mac n Cheese "cooking".  
如果你现在正在吃家常菜。你不可能吃得比在中国更差，因为你总是在餐馆吃饭。 除非你真的不会做饭，把热狗和麦克奶酪叫做“烹饪”。

i typically always cook simple meals no matter where we are. I'm talking about variety when we want to try something new or have something outside our normal without cooking. Eating out in the US always ruins my insides tbh and not even worth it, does not happen in the guo, just my experience  
无论在哪里我都做简单的饭菜。我说的是多样性，当我们想尝试一些新的东西或有一些超出我们正常的没有烹饪。在美国外出就餐总是毁了我的内心，甚至不值得，在中国不会发生，只是我的经验。

A lot restaurant food in China is very fatty or salty or fried in oil or all of the above. In America if you know how to cook (as in make stock from scratch, cook fish properly, saute, etc) you can source really good ingredients. But for too many people in America "cooking" is heating something up in the microwave.

China (and Asia) is a collectivist society. People are on average tightly connected to their communities. This comes with the tradeoff of having lots of obligations, drama, gossiping and other general restrictions of individual freedom. There are lots of pros too. It's just different.  
中国（和亚洲）是一个集体主义社会。平均而言，人们与他们的社区联系紧密。这是与有很多义务，戏剧，八卦和其他个人自由的一般限制的权衡。也有很多优点。只是不一样。

I have to agree with then friend culture. In Canada I had three or four friends that I would see regularly but always booking a week or at least a few days in advance.  
我不得不同意朋友文化。 在加拿大，我有三四个朋友，我会定期去看他们，但总是提前一周或至少几天预订。

I have far more friends in China than I ever had in Canada. And they are reliable friends. They are there whenI need them and they are generous and easy to get along with.  
我在中国的朋友比我在加拿大的朋友多得多。 他们是可靠的朋友。 当我需要他们的时候，他们就在那里，他们很慷慨，很容易沿着。

To be honest it's a big reason I left too, people I used to hang out with left for one reason or another and my final year in China was very lonely + I didn't like my job and wanted a "career" back in the US. I think it's more a universal thing than just the US. I still think China is a great environment for friendship bc you live close and have similar lifestyles, but people are the same no matter where you are  
老实说，这也是我离开的一个很大的原因，我过去经常和别人一起出去玩的人因为这样或那样的原因离开了，我在中国的最后一年非常孤独+我不喜欢我的工作，想在美国有一个“职业生涯”。我认为这不仅仅是美国的事情。我仍然认为中国是一个很好的友谊环境，因为你们住得很近，生活方式也很相似，但无论你在哪里，人们都是一样的

Depends what you mean. Adults over 30 don't really have friends. Just acquaintances you do stuff with. 

For getting those go out more and have more hobbies. 

If I show up to a random hobby club in China (for example I fly RC planes every Saturday) everyone is trying to add my WeChat.

I'd say the most important appeal to China is it's safety. I feel like China is extremely safe compared to many other countries. And it counts for a lot. The culture, people, landscape makes it a big draw for tourism and it's safety is impressive ... considering there is more than a billion people.  
我想说，对中国最重要的吸引力是它的安全性。我觉得中国和其他国家相比是非常安全的。这很重要。文化，人民，景观使其成为旅游业的一大吸引力，它的安全性令人印象深刻。毕竟地球上有十亿多人口

The other points you made come at a cost. I love WeChat for being able to put everything under one app, but it comes at the expense of your personal information. WeChat is every government security agency's wet dream. To have all of its citizens spending habits, chat history, call records, location history, etc all in one database.  
你提出的其他观点是有代价的。我喜欢微信，因为它可以把所有东西都放在一个应用程序下，但这是以牺牲你的个人信息为代价的。微信是每个政府安全机构的梦遗。将所有公民的消费习惯，聊天记录，通话记录，位置历史等都放在一个数据库中。

It's extremely easy to find people, however, most government agencies have resources they have access to, but WeChat consolidates it (for better or for worse). To me though, most citizens have nothing to hide so I personally don't think it's a drawback and I imagine the West would be adopting something similar in 10 years. It'll get pushback, but that's how the world works.  
找人非常容易，然而，大多数政府机构都有他们可以访问的资源，但微信巩固了它（无论好坏）。对我来说，大多数公民没有什么可隐瞒的，所以我个人不认为这是一个缺点，我想西方将在10年内采用类似的东西。会有阻力，但世界就是这样。

In regards to censorship, your points doesn't even mention anything compelling for it.  
关于审查制度，你的观点甚至没有提到任何令人信服的东西。

I would say that it can control the amount of junk that comes in, but that's not true. The amount of advertisements and obvious scams that pop out everywhere (WeChat ads, when you turn on your TV, etc) is disgusting.  
我会说它可以控制垃圾的数量，但这不是真的。到处弹出的广告和明显的骗局（微信广告，当你打开电视时，等等）令人厌恶。

Censorship of information is bad. Period. It hampers progress and creativity.  
信息审查是不好的。期它阻碍了进步和创造力。

But with that said, I think the best draw for China is it's personal safety. You just don't get that in major cities in US  
但话虽如此，我认为中国最大的吸引力是人身安全。你在美国的大城市里是找不到的

八年前我从伦敦搬到中国，从那以后我从未后悔过。

I got a huge pay rise, my company helped me relocate my wife and daughter, helped me to find a school and gave me an apartment for six months while I found my own. Not to forget the golden handshake when i passed probation.  
我得到了大幅加薪，我的公司帮助我重新安置了我的妻子和女儿，帮助我找到了一所学校，并在我找到自己的公寓时给了我六个月的公寓。别忘了我通过试用期时的握手礼。

I spend half my time in the Mainland and the other half in HK.  
我一半时间在内地，另一半在香港。

I love how the cities are so quiet these days due to the massive transition to EVs, the public transport is just freaking amazing here, quiet, clean and always on time.  
我喜欢这些天的城市是如此安静，因为大规模的过渡到电动汽车，公共交通是非常惊人的在这里，安静，干净，总是准时。

I spend a hell of a lot of time travelling to different parts of China and the high speed railway is always my preferred option.  
我花了很多时间去中国的不同地方旅行，高速铁路一直是我的首选。

I find it funny that westerners have been so brainwashed to hate and look down on China and the Chinese. They simply have no idea or refuse to accept the realities of modern China.

Honking was always theoretically banned in the cities but was really difficult to enforce in the past. However that changed around 10 years ago with systems that would triangulate the noise and produce a noise heat map to auto identify the offending car.  
理论上讲，城市里一直禁止鸣笛，但在过去很难执行。 然而，大约10年前，这种情况发生了变化，系统可以对噪音进行三角测量，并生成噪音热图，以自动识别违规车辆。

When the system first rolled out in Shanghai they put up screens at busy intersections that would show the license plate number of who was honking; you would then get a text message about getting fined about 5 min later.  
当该系统第一次在上海推出时，他们在忙碌的十字路口安装了屏幕，显示谁在按喇叭;然后你会在大约5分钟后收到一条关于罚款的短信。

Honking disappeared really quickly after that.  
喇叭声很快就消失了。

Same thing with not yielding to pedestrians—after electronic enforcement systems were put in place cars now are super cautious with pedestrians lest they get fined.  
同样的事情也发生在不向行人屈服的情况下在电子执法系统安装到位后，汽车现在对行人非常谨慎，以免被罚款。

I was in Zhuhai when COVID hit, not too far from the Zhuhai international circuit (I can hear the F1 cars).

I was pretty scared to be honest. But the Zhuhai place is a closed garden with a small supermarket, a few cafe/restaurant places and I pretty much had everything delivered to my door usually from Taobao.

I was pretty lucky because the garden complex is huge, it’s called Horizon Cove, take a look online it’s a cool place and there is a lot of space to walk outside (within the complex). Hundreds of trees, even an artificial river and a waterfall (and snakes).

Venturing outside was like a ghost town, so eerie. In the first few months, I would estimate half the shops didn’t open or only at irregular hours.

There were check points all around the city, hundreds of them. The cops would check your temperature.

Everyone wore a face mask and if someone didn’t he/she will get a crap load of abuse. Some people still wear face masks to this very day (I’m not joking).

Then there was the app. Every shop had a QR code and you had to use the app to get in. Without it, you can’t enter.

Everyone’s app indicated where you’ve been and how many times you’ve been vaccinated. If you were not vaccinated you basically couldn’t get into shops.

Also whenever someone was diagnosed with COVID, they either had to stay at home where a device was stuck to the door to prevent them from leaving or they had to go to a recovery centre.

My work requires travelling around China, but i was lucky that my role was switched so I could work from home. Even to this day, despite reverting back to my original role, we aren’t as busy and we have a fair amount of idle time to be honest.

My wife and daughter were in Yunnan at the time and after I think it was four/five months they came to Zhuhai after arranging a car journey. This was horrendously difficult because everyone needed permission to leave and enter a province, so they had to contact multiple provinces to get the passes (very long journey I think they ended up in the car for around 16 hours).

After around 18 months in Zhuhai working from home and my daughter’s taking online classes, we went to Hong Kong.

HK didn’t shutdown at all during the pandemic and the sheer density of people was a bit of a shock. Despite encouraging social distancing, everyone was huddled together.

Towards the tail end of the pandemic, when I had gotten used to it all I eventually caught COVID and so did my daughter. My wife, I suspect is one of those who are immune to it.

Gosh I haven’t thought about this for so long, brings back memories.

Moved to China for an expat assignment in August, and about to go back to the US for ~3 weeks to see family for the holidays. Am fully expecting this culture shock.  
八月份搬到中国去做外派工作，准备回美国3周去看家人度假。我很期待这种文化冲击。

Another important one for me: personal safety in daily life. Last night on impulse, I went for a 30 min walk around 9:45 pm, and at some point I realized how amazing it was to be going down lively streets in the dark by myself, with people of all kinds around, and not a single worry about being mugged, harassed, or worse. I could not do that -- at least not carefree -- in the semi-urban neighborhood of my mid-sized city in the US, much less the top 10 city I grew up in.  
另一个对我来说很重要的是：日常生活中的个人安全。昨晚一时冲动，我在晚上9点45分左右走了30分钟，在某个时候，我意识到独自一人在黑暗中走在热闹的街道上是多么的神奇，周围有各种各样的人，没有一个人担心被抢劫，骚扰，或者更糟。我不能这样做--至少不能无忧无虑--在我所在的美国中等城市的半城市化社区，更不用说我成长的十大城市了。

Can you talk about the crime. Almost everytime people talk about china, they say basically no crime. I'm having a very hard time believing this. Take Japan for example, low crime country at face value but when you start digging, you realize the type of crime committed is different but there are a ton of them, for example, sexual assault and harassment of women, is an epidemic. But looking at official crime data, you'll see that police only have a have conviction rate because they largely only open cases they are certain they can solve and sweep everything else under the rug. And that's for the crimes that are even reported to them.  
你能谈谈犯罪吗？几乎每次人们谈到中国，他们都说基本上没有犯罪。我很难相信。以日本为例，表面上犯罪率低，但当你开始挖掘时，你会意识到所犯罪行的类型不同，但有很多，例如，性侵犯和骚扰妇女，是一种流行病。但是看看官方的犯罪数据，你会发现警察只有一个有定罪率，因为他们在很大程度上只打开案件，他们肯定他们可以解决和扫地毯下的一切。这还只是针对向他们报告的犯罪行为。

So is China similar? There is a ton of crime, but the type of crime is different (Harassment, scams, etc)? Is it just less visible and not as widely reported? Or do you honestly believe crime is just lower in china?  
中国也是如此吗？有一吨的犯罪，但犯罪类型是不同的（骚扰，诈骗等）？它只是不那么明显，没有被广泛报道？或者你真的相信中国的犯罪率比美国低？

China is low crime not zero crime. You don’t feel threatened when you move around China. Yes sexual crimes are there but punishment is so severe that people are reluctant. Chinese are scared of there government so they tend to avoid doing hard crimes. Most hard Chinese criminals have there base in south east Asia like Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos where law is lax and outside Chinese jurisdiction.

I haven't been able to enjoy walking in Guangzhou since scooters became common about 5 years ago. They dominate the sidewalks and I have to be constantly aware and careful not to walk in front of one. So many near collisions.....

I have to disagree with number 3.

Why on earth would you want a single company to own data for every aspect of your life ? Google already creeps people out with how much data they have on you, and you think it would be a luxury if I also had to stream tv shows, book appointments with my doctor, add my bank account etc. I don’t see anything to envy about WeChat and a single company has so much control.

Regarding point 3, yeah, no thanks.

The flip side of having everything in WeChat is that people don’t have a choice, and all your info is in one app.

What if I don’t like WeChat as an app? Personally, I find WeChat as an app to be pretty mediocre in terms of quality and ease of use.

The desktop app is severely limited; chat messages are not saved the way many other western messaging apps do; photos and videos you received take up local storage; you can’t scrub voice messages the way you can with WhatsApp, and you can’t play them at faster speeds.

The list goes on. I can see the convenience aspect, but to me, the cons outweigh that one single pro.

And there’s no alternative. I see that as a huge potential single point of failure.

40 years ago as an engineering student, I remember we had one class in "International Business" our something like that. I remember only a couple of things ... and one of them was how reverse culture shock is usually stronger and harder to deal with than culture shock. With reverse culture shock, you think you are back in your own familiar environment. But .... things are different, your friends don't understand you, but you exorcist things to be the same as when you left. Coming from China, even worse, because of the massively incorrect assumptions people here have about life in China.

You just become more in tune to the little everyday idiosyncrasies around you, regardless of where you find yourself. And you'll always just be soaking them up. It's a pretty neat and handy thing if you ask me.  
但是，当然，回国时会遇到文化冲击。如果你在欧洲生活了一段时间后回到家里，情况也是如此。无论您身在何处，您都会变得更加适应周围的日常小习惯。你就一直在吸收它们。如果你问我的话，这是一个非常整洁和方便的东西。

Yeah OP seems to be comparing a certain place where they live in China to a certain place where they are in the US. I'm sure the opposite comparison could be made if the two places were reversed. I have a different experience whenever I go home for the holidays - it's a breath of fresh air and something I look forward to every year. Not to say I can't stand it in China; there are certainly many things to like, but home is great too.

This is my favorite thread on this sub. The differences between china and the US are so eye opening for me coming from the US.  
这是我在这艘潜艇上最喜欢的线程。中国和美国之间的差异让我大开眼界。

I got the extreme case of reverse culture shock after moving to beautiful clean Pudong Shanghai and then coming back to Central Los Angeles. Culture shock is an understatement.  
搬到美丽干净的上海浦东，然后回到洛杉矶市中心后，我遇到了反向文化冲击的极端案例。文化冲击是一个保守的说法。

For the entire time i was in china i damn near forgot about crime, obesity, drugs, social justice warriors, political correctness, gender wars, and all the other BS that's shoved down our throat each day in California. My mental health improved dramatically.  
在中国的整个时间里，我几乎忘记了犯罪、肥胖、毒品、社会正义战士、政治正确、性别战争，以及所有其他每天在加州被我们塞进喉咙的废话。我的心理健康得到了显著改善。

Coming back to California i realized how narcissistic, crazy, overly sexualized, and overweight we are in California. Also really had to worry about things like transportation and food costs. Upon arriving to my hotel i had to pay 100USD to get deodorant (40 for uber 2mi each way to walmart and 15 for deodorant). My mind was blown.  
回到加州，我意识到我们在加州是多么自恋、疯狂、过度性感和超重。还真的不得不担心交通和食品成本等问题。到达酒店后，我不得不花100美元买除臭剂（40美元买优步2英里去沃尔玛的，15美元买除臭剂）。我的脑子被炸开了。

I miss the street food, the walkability, the sounds, the busy streets, the friendly curious people, the random singing and dancing, riding bikes, and the cheap and convenient transportation in china.  
我想念中国的街头小吃，步行，声音，忙碌的街道，友好好奇的人们，随意的歌舞，骑自行车，以及便宜便捷的交通。

But take all of my experience with a grain of salt. My situation was a bit different in that i don't have to work in china. And even if i did work, it would be for fun not for income. I think once you enter the workforce your experience of china can quickly become less of a novelty and more like a native. At that point it could be harder to step back from the BS of work and enjoy everything around you. But it's still very possible and i have made American friends who stayed in china for 10yr with this positive mindset. The work culture is quite brutal though, i understand that.  
但我对我所有的经验持保留态度。我的情况有点不同，因为我不必在中国工作。即使我真的工作了，也是为了好玩，而不是为了收入。我认为，一旦你进入劳动力市场，你对中国的经历很快就会变得不那么新奇，而更像是本土人。在这一点上，你可能更难从工作的BS中退出来，享受你周围的一切。但这仍然是很有可能的，我已经交了一些美国朋友，他们带着这种积极的心态在中国呆了10年。工作文化很残酷，我明白。

Not really in my case, I worked in Beijing for 12 years and loved it (but I wasn't a teacher though, I am not sure I would enjoy that). I enjoyed living and working somewhat like a local, I rode my bike to and from work, went to the local joints for lunch, hung out with some coworkers after work, etc. On weekends, I hung out at the park, sharing smokes, flying kites, talking birds, and chatting. I preferred being more like 'a native', I spent most of my time with locals and avoiding the expat bubble. I miss that lifestyle.  
我在北京工作了12年，很喜欢那里（但我不是老师，我不确定我会喜欢那里）。我喜欢像当地人一样生活和工作，我骑自行车上下班，去当地的餐馆吃午饭，下班后和一些同事出去玩，等等。周末，我在公园里闲逛，分享香烟，放风筝，谈论鸟类，聊天。我更喜欢做一个“本地人”，我大部分时间都和当地人在一起，避免了外国人的泡沫。我怀念那种生活方式。

I really miss the street life that has vanished in Beijing. I loved all the street vendors, the shabby shops scratch-built along the sidewalks, etc. that used to be. Now when I go back, it is less lively, more sterile compared to 2016 and earlier, but I still prefer it to the States.  
我真的很怀念北京已经消失的街头生活。我喜欢所有的街头小贩，那些沿着人行道的破旧商店，等等。现在当我回去的时候，与2016年和更早的时候相比，它不那么活泼，更贫瘠，但我仍然喜欢它。

I long for the 2000's version of China, I romanticize that era. I don't notice the cultural changes much, I never watch TV, and I avoid most American social media, I just come to reddit to talk about China and Chinese food. But we have a place in Beijing we go back to often, I just am waiting for the day my corp lets me work remotely outside the lower 48.  
我渴望2000年的中国，我把那个时代浪漫化了。我没有注意到文化上的变化，我从不看电视，我避开大多数美国社交媒体，我只是来Reddit谈论中国和中国菜。但我们在北京有一个地方，我们经常回去，我只是在等待我的公司允许我在48号公路外远程工作的那一天。

No kidding. I was in China for a few years already, but I went to the States for the holidays (2006 or 2007?), and I couldn't believe how much larger people were. Then I noticed these extra-wide wheelchairs at the airport, the benches at the airport had some that were larger. Even when I went to a doctor for a checkup, they had special xxl chairs in the waiting room. It was shocking. I mean, I remember some larger people before I moved, but the number of obese, and even the increase in size of the average obese person was shocking.

That was 2006-2007? The sad reality is that Americans have ballooned in size since then. Nearly 70% of the adult population is officially overweight, 40% are obese. And why is healthcare so expensive there? Because fat Americans lack self-restraint and are eating themselves to death

I work in China for 2 months at a time. There is always something that shocks me coming home but it is different each time. The last time the first thing I did was go to the farmer's market which was a big shock. It was so upper middle class sincere liberal American -- everyone white, lots of people taller than me (I'm average in the US), lots of people fatter than me (I'm often the fattest person around in Guangzhou, though in the USA I'm just average), everyone walking their dogs, no one carrying an umbrella, a local band playing sincere folk music. I was struck by people collecting petitions for ballot initiatives, one of which was to ban trophy hunting of mountain lions. I felt like -- we Americans are lucky to have some democratic options -- yet what are we using our democracy for? I have nothing against mountain lions but really? Is this the best we can do? What's the point anyways? I was a bit embarrassed even.

People here on chinalife are always saying much safer they feel in China. I actually always feel safer in America. I think it is important to note that in terms of risks in life, violent crime almost anywhere in the world is less common that injuries in traffic accidents, fires, etc. In terms of violent crime, both my medium size city in America and Guangzhou seem to have similar (low) violent crime rates. I'm comfortable walking by myself at night in both cities as a middle aged woman. However, in most other ways Guangzhou is much more dangerous, particularly for traffic hazards. I have given up walking outside of campus in Guangzhou because I am constantly being almost run over by scooters who dominate all the sidewalks. It is much worse than when I first started working in China 10 years ago when I could actually enjoy taking a walk -- it was crowded then but everyone was on foot and there wasn't a risk of getting run over.

The grass is always greener because we tend to focus on the negatives more than the positive aspects instead of merely seeing them as differences.

I certainly don't miss the public spitting, the oily food, the inability to walk on pavements because they're taken up by scooters or randomly parked cars. The busy periods where parents pick up kids from school and you are in a massive safety hazard, the lack of public spaces where you can just roam freely or not feel like you're being watched or controlled, the suspicion over the food quality, the constant noise pollution; drilling, hammering, and loud music from phones, line dancing, or shops. The sight of children publicly shitting or pissing outside shopping malls, the lack of good art and music culture, the lack of good books. The dumbing down of so many things, and the feeling that you are inside a bubble. The pervasive propaganda, reminders or nationalistic pride, and the general repetition of things. The sight of animals being mistreated. The fact that I do have to pay for a VPN or use one too, and having to circumvent blockers or anti VPN sites. The way that apps are too critical to living there, and how during Covid it was a nightmare for many foreigners using apps within apps that didn't function properly.

Then again, I miss the ease of which it was to get seen by a doctor, even if it was rarely fixed first time round. The many walks available along rivers, and new sites that pop up. The bike hires and that short period when the spring is up and the weather is good. The financial burdens being lessened considerably, the ease of paying for things, even if it meant spending more than you might usually. The potential for taking up other hobbies...

In the end you have to pick and choose what rubbish aspects you are most willing to tolerate. I think that is the key to living.

Agree with everything except the 4th one. Yea, you can use a VPN or shadowsucks, but they aren't always reliable which can be annoying or depending on server or type won't reliably bypass region restrictions (Netflix, Crunchyroll, etc). Online multiplayer gaming is doable if you have a game accelerator. Smarthome stuff kind of suck even if you're using Apple or something and if you have a VPN router it gets trickier. As for local Chinese internet the caveat is learning Chinese.

Multiple apps is borne from American software philosophy (lean and such) where companies find a single narrow use case "app should do only one thing and do it well" and iterate the heck out of it. It's very rare that a company will make and develop a unified platform anymore, only a few companies still do it. Everyone else makes a narrow app. No synergy, nothing cohesive about it. Annoying to both use in personal life and in the workplace.  
多个应用程序源于美国的软件哲学（精益之类）公司发现一个单一的狭窄用例“应用程序应该只做一件事，而且做得很好”，然后把它排除在外。一家公司将制作和开发一个统一的平台是非常罕见的，只有少数公司仍然这样做。其他人都制作一个狭窄的应用程序。没有协同作用，没有什么凝聚力。在个人生活和工作场所使用都很烦人。

The tap of your phone is linked to a credit/debit card. Almost all point of sale credit card machines allow it now days. When at a restaurant normally you are handed a receipt on a tray with the charges and you place your CC/cash on it. You eating at McDonalds or chain restaurant with a sticky order/pay thingy on the table is not a good comparison. No finer dining restaurant is going to drag out a portable wifi CC processing machine for you to hover your phone over it or have an area where you pay before you go in at some dirty buffet place.

Sounds like OP finally went to a proper sit down restaurant and was shocked they had actual service from wait staff.

You also do not have to worry about watered down drinks, fake booze, clean water, and all the fun stuff you get from 3rd world countries.

 Where the hell are you living?? Every major restaurant does this in Canada, after you finish your meal, like a civilized country. It's the only the small places that couldn't afford to update their system that will force you to insert your card.

Edit: as a matter of fact, people still can go up to the counter to pay, but that's usually the small diners that don't want to pay for the mobile machine, or are just understaffed.

No real reverse culture shock for me, but plenty of non-reverse culture shock for my Chinese wife.  
对我来说没有真实的反向文化冲击，但对我的中国妻子来说有很多非反向文化冲击。

I was in China as an expat, not an immigrant, and our company went to great lengths to make sure we could enjoy the lifestyle we left behind, which meant we didn't have to live like the middle-class Chinese we worked with every day.  
我在中国是一个外籍人士，而不是一个移民，我们的公司竭尽全力确保我们能够享受我们留下的生活方式，这意味着我们不必像我们每天工作的中产阶级中国人那样生活。

Obviously a lot of us _did_ leave our walled communities (and met women who eventually became our spouses) and learned some Chinese and enjoyed the culture, but for the most part, we were there to work, and so we had western groceries delivered from Shanghai once a week, home leave once a year, R&R leave twice a year, a car with driver (although I got my license and often drove myself), shopped at Metro and Decathlon and Ikea, used credit cards everywhere, lived in normal houses or duplexes instead of apartments, and used all of the foreign medical services, clinics, and hospitals.  
显然我们中的很多人离开了我们的封闭社区显然我们中的很多_人离开了我们的封闭_社区（并遇到了最终成为我们配偶的女性），学习了一些中文，享受了文化，但大多数情况下，我们在那里工作，所以我们每周从上海运送一次西方杂货，每年一次探亲假，每年两次R&R假，一辆带司机的汽车（尽管我拿到了驾照，经常自己开车），在地铁、迪卡侬和宜家购物，到处使用信用卡，住在普通的房子或复式公寓里，使用所有的外国医疗服务，诊所和医院。

There was nothing to be reverse-shocked about.  
没什么好大惊小怪的。

The biggest shock was seeing how much older everyone in the office looked after only five years.  
最令人震惊的是，看到办公室里的每个人在短短五年后看起来都老了很多。

On the other hand there are things that the US / West does better than China.

1 big ass houses with land. Try getting a 6k - 10k sq ft mansion with lawn in the middle of Shanghai / BJ / Shenzhen. You really need to be a billionaire to make it happen . On the other hand it's still within reach for the average doctor / tech worker in the USA.
========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

2 cooking at home. Your big house lets you store so many more advanced cooking gadgets. Your fridge can now fit an entire cow, you have two ovens, and a stove that is 5' long. Try cooking a Thanksgiving turkey dinner for 12 people in your average chinese apartment. It's gonna be tough. But in the USA, your 10k sq ft home has a kitchen is as big as many peoples apartments in China. Don't forget you can also do BBQs now and good quality meats / cheeses / seafood is super accessible.
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

3 Accumulating a crapload of stuff. If you buy a home beside a costco...you can buy enough food for 1 month per trip, and fit it all into your car. 10 minutes later and it's at your home. No stairs or elevators or worrying about how to take things home. If you want a grand piano , no problem ...if you want a 100" TV, someone will deliver it... you don't have to worry about how to fit something into your elevator.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

4 random ass hobbies. If you decide you want to start growing weed, it's totally legal in most states / Canada. Want to start a koi pond? Just dig a big hole in your backyard with your excavator that you store in your garage for fun. Can't do the same in China. Also if you want to start gardening or working on your car , no problem. In China you neither have a garden nor a garage if you want to live right in the middle of the city...
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

5 staying home. Once you get your giant ass home and fill it with all the useless stuff you could ever want, you don't even need to leave home. Head to your garage or theater or kitchen when you are bored, take a bath when you want to relax, or hang out in your yard when you want nature...., oh yeah let's not forget you now have your own private pool and gym.

sry....its your personal problem if you buy i kid kitchen for your own home...dont blame china for it.

So you get a 6k -10k sq ft mansion with lawn in the middle of Manhatten NewYork or Washington or Los Angeles without a billionaire? for real? as a normal doc or tech worker? you can earn a million i a year and get problems to buy something in the silicon valley so what are you talking about? why i should pay millions for a appartment with crackheads all over the streets?

Something like this :

Not cheap but you don't need to be a billionaire. Its still within reach of your average tech executive with stock options or doctor / dentist. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Salary/comments/1hcs1ot/im\_a\_general\_dentist\_i\_own\_my\_own\_practice\_i\_work/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Salary/comments/1hcs1ot/im_a_general_dentist_i_own_my_own_practice_i_work/)

Especially after 10-20 years of savings.

I just got back from China for just a brief trip and I’m totally with you - US is like light years behind and I hadn’t visited in 10 years and it’s changed so much in China. I could definitely see myself living there since the transportation was much more accessible albeit just way more people to deal with but it definitely made me reconsider. With the next US admin pretty sure can surpass us is my personal opinion and I liked that I didn’t have to worry being shot at at night.  
我刚从中国回来，只是一次短暂的旅行，我完全同意你的观点--美国落后了好几光年，我已经10年没有访问过中国了，中国的变化太大了。我可以肯定地看到自己住在那里，因为交通更方便，虽然只是更多的人来处理，但它肯定让我重新考虑。我个人认为，下一届美国政府肯定会超过我们，我喜欢这样，我不必担心在晚上被射杀。

I miss China but I can't live without my 2 acres in Massachusetts and see wild life visiting my yard. Yeah payment tools in the US are pathetically backwards. We still use checks. But life is about the quality of the air I breathe.

The feeling is real. I miss ubiquitous mobile payments. Sure, Apple Pay is kinda sorta easier to use (two clicks of the side button instead of opening an app and hitting a button) but it’s _wrong._ Living in China definitely spoiled me in some ways, but it was time to go home and get on with life.

Transportation. Was in South Florida. No drivers license. Public transportation sucks. Took Amtrak from Fort Lauderdale to Orlando. At times we rolled along at 10 MPH. Took four hours. So used to CRH zooming at 150 mph and the fare is cheap. And yep, that US tipping thing. Everyone expects a tip. Bought a can of Coke on that Amtrak. Dude expected a tip and gave me a dirty look when I didn't. Let's not even talk about the Orlando Amtrak station. I think it's 100 years old.

On your point 3 I personally believe aggregating a lot of functions into one large body is never the best from a tech perspective. On your point 4, yes it is such a comical misconception there is a great firewall but to be honest it is nowhere near "great status" it isn't even annoying if you know what you are doing.

I just returned from China last week after a little over 3 months and by and large agree with the observations here. I loved Weixin Pay because it's so handy with every vendor you deal with whether it's fine dining or going to a market with 50 different vendors.

We were in Dandong which is a teir three city and is definitely not quiet. Upon reflection, I think that there is significantly less honking in Beijing. I happened to stay in a hotel in Dandong for a few days and could hear the street noise on the 21st floor.

Scooters, bikes, and pedestrians are everywhere and overwhelmingly common. It is weird that there is no one on the streets walking or on bikes. Traffic is hugely different, which I think is mostly due to enforcement. Although cameras are very common in China, I never once saw someone pulled over for any traffic infraction in China.

China is without a doubt safer than the States. While we were there i think there were three mass stabbings and one attack by car that was horrific but here every day the news is a litany of people's crimes against each other. One could claim that it's selective reporting but I truly don't believe that to be the case, culturally there just doesn't seem to be the prevalent going to guns that there is here. Of course, China has an iron hand on gun possession and even though I am a gun owner and 2nd Amendment advocate I can see that if guns aren't a part of culture life is much safer.

I am not a big fan of WeChat as social media, like has been expressed here it's mediocre in it's interactions between $ outside of your close circle.

Dandong outside of the city core was a mixture of high rise developments and village culture. Everywhere that hadn't yet been developed had a Warren of villages that seemed poverty stricken but I've been in several homes that looked like that from the outside, but when you got inside there was a large screen TV and smart phones in evidence.

Health care is another huge difference, here it's controlled by big pharma, insurance and the medical establishment. In China if you have something wrong you can go to a doctor and have it addressed. There are many drugs that are available OTC there or that are just not offered.

I honestly will probably never go back home to the states until I have children, because that's the one thing I don't want to put them through, the school system here.

I am eternally grateful to China because the lifestyle and low-stress enabled me to lose 31 kgs, which was gained by the awful food lifestyle we have in the USA. People always joke about how easy it is to gain weight in China but I feel the exact opposite. Going home the last summer and I was astounded by the amount of obese people I saw, it's geninuely horrifying what we as Americans have allowed ourselves to become because so many of us don't give a shit about our health.

100 CNY vs 100 USD, which is more valuable? The answer is 100 CNY because that can buy you more labor in China vs 100 USD in US.

I miss having amazing nights out and not worrying about a load of people fighting for no reason. Honestly, there is a distinct type of person in the UK who just goes out to cause trouble a lot of the time. In China everybody just wants to have fun.

And even though there is of course anti-foreigner sentiment, it is very rarely actually mentioned. Only around covid time did I ever hear people have a bad thing to say about me in public/within earshot. In the UK, people don't care about being openly racist, sexist, discriminatory, vulgar etc.

So, what the fock about the "censorship"? Just like Trump wants to erase Chinese EV from US market, China wants to erase US social medial from Chinese market. It's not censorship, it's "market reserve".

But well, let me tell you what you'll MOST miss. SECURITY. In every single sense of this word.

Of course, you are not a liar, but that is not the case for local nationals.

As an American, what you see while living in a T1 or T2 city may prove that another American can live well in China, but it cannot prove that China is a good and normal country.

Otherwise, I would say that Rodman is living well in North Korea, and North Korea should be an excellent country.

you got to adjust your life again. nothing perfect, before you came back to US, all are regulated strict by the goverment, this is the way with unified apps so simple.

you have to own your car unless living in subways or LRT systems in US

I do not trust QR code in US, it is the gateway of unfortune

as I know, most business are accepting CC ( DO NOT use DEBIT CARD that very dangerous). but some small stores are having minimum total for using CC or using cash.

apps? yeah mine having multiple apps, this is the way :P.

my subjective experience when transplanted to US

10 years in China and back here in the States for a few. I agree China does somethings better than the US, but why lie? Why embellish?

1st driving- America has a ton of walkable cities, New York, San Fran, Chicago, Boston, DC. There are many places in the US where one needs a car, but to suggest China has “more walkable cities” is silly.

2nd I agree that China largely has America beat on payments, but I can’t think of one restaurant in the last 7 years that didn’t accept digital payments. And to suggest you had to go to your car to get your debit card to pay with a group of friends is clearly a lie. Most folks have/use cash app, Venmo, Apple Pay or Zelle.

I agree China does somethings well but come on: no need to just right out lie.

This doesn’t seem accurate to me - in those very cities there are still lots of places that only accept cash, particularly in ethnic enclaves for example. It’s more than pre covid but certainly not universal.

Also I don’t think it’s controversial that the US does not have very walkable cities, on balance. The ones you referenced are basically the only examples in the country, outside of maybe a few small neighborhoods in other medium to large cities. Virtually every city built in the 20th century is not walkable and was designed around the automobile, to an extent that I think is just not true in China.

Hong Kong SAR

As someone who lived in one of those major American cities, certain parts are walkable but even then you are best off either driving or getting an Uber/Taxi. If you're lucky maybe your metro can take you somewhere, but its not as safe as in Asia nor nearly as fast or comfortable or in any metric better.

Everywhere else you need a car. There is absolutely no way the USA has more walkable cities than China or even most of Europe / Asia

Even those cities you mentioned aren’t as walkable as tier 1 Chinese cities, and the cities you mentioned are outliers

Yeah no. There ARE definitely more walkable cities in China. There’s just more cities in China in general. Why are you accusing people of lying?

Until you need your medical bill covered by your insurance company.  But I do enjoy that in America, you have the fundamental right to shoot someone if they are running a company in a way that I don’t agree with.  China should adopt a little bit more of that.

Who needs freedom when you can order a meal for less than 30RMB delivered by a recent Ph.D grad. All the misfortunes that happen to the Chinese that make his/her lifestyle possible have nothing to do with the expats. No one gonna bothers him for using a VPN.

As for the foods in China,.. enjoy them while you can. Your body can only deal with so much toxicity from cooking oil kept in containers meant for crude, etc. The age-standardized mortality rate of cancer there is 1.5 times higher than in the US.
